# LinC2R-30

## 📖 Overview
This dataset is designed for research and evaluation of the **C to Rust translation task**, with a focus on migrating Linux kernel modules.  
Each subfolder contains a small Linux kernel component, including the original C source code and the **Rust header files generated by bindgen**.  
The dataset provides a **reproducible benchmark** for experiments, testing, and improvement of methods and tools for C→Rust translation.

## 📂 Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized as follows:
datasets/
│
├── arc4/ # arc4 encryption module
├── base64/ # base64 encoding/decoding
├── blake2s/ # blake2s hash function
├── chacha/ # chacha cipher module
├── checksum/ # generic checksum utilities
├── clzctz/ # bit count/ctz utilities
├── crc32/ # CRC32 checksum
├── debug_lock/ # debug locking module
...

- Each folder corresponds to one **Linux kernel submodule**.  
- Inside each folder:
  - `*.c` / `*.h`: Original Linux kernel C source files  
  - `*.rs`: Rust header files generated from C using **bindgen**
 

### 📊 Metrics
The `metric/` directory contains Python scripts for evaluating translation quality and safety:
metric/
│
├── calculate_MML.py # Script to calculate Minimum Match Length (MML) metric
├── safe_ratio.py # Script to compute the ratio of safety-related translations

These metrics can be used to **quantify translation performance** and provide objective measures 

## 🔧 Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LYC127/LinC2R-30.git
   cd LinC2R-30/datasets
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific module (e.g., arc4/) to access its C source and the corresponding bindgen-generated Rust files.
3. Use the dataset for translation experiments, whether with C2Rust, other tools, or custom approaches for C→Rust migration.
4. Use the scripts in metric/ to evaluate the quality and safety of translated outputs.
   ```bash
   # Calculate Minimum Match Length (MML)
   python metric/calculate_MML.py datasets/arc4/arc4_bindgen.rs
  
   # Compute safe translation ratio
   python metric/safe_ratio.py datasets/arc4/arc4_bindgen.rs
   ```

## 🎯 Research Value
- Provides a **lightweight, modular kernel dataset**, lowering experimental complexity.  
- Enables direct comparison between **original C interfaces** and **Rust mappings**.  
- Serves as a benchmark for studying the **general task of C→Rust translation**.  
- Useful for evaluating or training **LLM-based code translation models** and compiler-assisted migration tools.  

## 📌 Notes
- The dataset includes selected small modules from the Linux kernel and follows the Linux kernel open-source license (GPL-2.0).  
- Intended **for research and academic purposes only**, not for production use.
