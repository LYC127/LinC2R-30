# LinC2R-30

## ðŸ“– Overview
This dataset is designed for research and evaluation of the **C to Rust translation task**, with a focus on migrating Linux kernel modules.  
Each subfolder contains a small Linux kernel component, including the original C source code and the **Rust header files generated by bindgen**.  
The dataset provides a **reproducible benchmark** for experiments, testing, and improvement of methods and tools for Câ†’Rust translation.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized as follows:
datasets/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ arc4/ # arc4 encryption module
â”œâ”€â”€ base64/ # base64 encoding/decoding
â”œâ”€â”€ blake2s/ # blake2s hash function
â”œâ”€â”€ chacha/ # chacha cipher module
â”œâ”€â”€ checksum/ # generic checksum utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ clzctz/ # bit count/ctz utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ crc32/ # CRC32 checksum
â”œâ”€â”€ debug_lock/ # debug locking module
...


- Each folder corresponds to one **Linux kernel submodule**.  
- Inside each folder:
  - `*.c` / `*.h`: Original Linux kernel C source files  
  - `*.rs`: Rust header files generated from C using **bindgen**  

## ðŸ”§ Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/LinC2R-30.git
   cd LinC2R-30/datasets
   ```
2. Navigate to a specific module (e.g., arc4/) to access its C source and the corresponding bindgen-generated Rust files.
3. Use the dataset for translation experiments, whether with C2Rust, other tools, or custom approaches for Câ†’Rust migration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Value
- Provides a **lightweight, modular kernel dataset**, lowering experimental complexity.  
- Enables direct comparison between **original C interfaces** and **Rust mappings**.  
- Serves as a benchmark for studying the **general task of Câ†’Rust translation**.  
- Useful for evaluating or training **LLM-based code translation models** and compiler-assisted migration tools.  

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- The dataset includes selected small modules from the Linux kernel and follows the Linux kernel open-source license (GPL-2.0).  
- Intended **for research and academic purposes only**, not for production use.
